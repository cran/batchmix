Description: Semi-supervised and unsupervised Bayesian mixture models that
  simultaneously infer the cluster/class structure and a batch correction.
  Densities available are the multivariate normal and the multivariate t.
  The model sampler is implemented in C++. This package is aimed at analysis of
  low-dimensional data generated across several batches. See Coleman et al.
  (2022) <doi:10.1101/2022.01.14.476352> for details of the model.
